      <description>Suppose you have a repository called mainrepo and another repository called subrepo that you want to use inside mainrepo. You can just clone subrepo inside mainrepo and use it. However, if subrepo gets updated frequently, then you will have to clone it everytime and replace it inside mainrepo. If you want to view the history of commits made to subrepo , then you need to go to the remote repository where you cloned it from and see it there.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Jitesh. I am currently working as a programmer at Sony&amp;rsquo;s PixelOpus Studio in San Mateo. We released our first game called Entwined for PS4, PS3, PS Vita, iOS and Android. It is the first commercial game that I worked on and will always have a special place in my heart.
Before joining Sony, I got my Masters in Entertainment Technology from Carnegie Mellon&amp;rsquo;s Entertainment Technology Center (ETC). During this period, I did an internship at Microsoft where I worked with the Kinect Fun Labs team to create a bite-sized experience called Ninja Challenge.</description>
