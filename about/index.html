Hi! I&rsquo;m Jitesh. I am currently working as a programmer at Sony&rsquo;s PixelOpus Studio in San Mateo. We released our first game called Entwined for PS4, PS3, PS Vita, iOS and Android. It is the first commercial game that I worked on and will always have a special place in my heart.<br><br>
Before joining Sony, I got my Masters in Entertainment Technology from Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s Entertainment Technology Center (ETC). During this period, I did an internship at Microsoft where I worked with the Kinect Fun Labs team to create a bite-sized experience called Ninja Challenge. I did another internship with the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon where I worked on a simulation environment called Robot Virtual Worlds which enabled students to learn programming Lego Mindstorms NXT robots. I also helped as a Teaching Assistant for the Building Virtual Worlds class at ETC.<br><br>
Before coming to U.S, I worked at Indusgeeks where I worked on a wide range of projects including Dubai Metro and Clinispace. I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering and a Diploma degree in Computer Technology from Mumbai University.
I am interested to learn more about programming, game design, math and science. So, I am creating this space where I can learn and write about these things.</p>
