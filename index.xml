      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Jitesh. I am currently working as a programmer at Sony&amp;rsquo;s PixelOpus Studio in San Mateo. We released our first game called Entwined for PS4, PS3, PS Vita, iOS and Android. It is the first commercial game that I worked on and will always have a special place in my heart.
Before joining Sony, I got my Masters in Entertainment Technology from Carnegie Mellon&amp;rsquo;s Entertainment Technology Center (ETC). During this period, I did an internship at Microsoft where I worked with the Kinect Fun Labs team to create a bite-sized experience called Ninja Challenge.</description>
